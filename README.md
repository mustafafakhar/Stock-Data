# Stock-Data
While I was working for Aedvisor I was assigned a task to pull all the available data of stocks for one of the main shareholders of the company. After thorough research, I realised that it was very difficult to get your hands on the very original data of stocks. However, a few years should be enough to understand a specific trend of a certain stock.

Thus, this repository shows a very simple code that I came up with to acquire all the stock data from online sources (Yahoo) to an editable excel file. From there onwards, it can either be combined in one single sheet or managed as per the convenience. I hope I contributed to the coding community. Cheers!
